- When your bases are gone, the game is over
- Interceptors are launched by a finger-tap
- Sound effects enhance the gaming experience
- A remote database is used to track the top 10 scores among all players
- Scoring in the top 10 allows the user to enter their initials
- Scores are displayed at the end of the game
